My first project is a simple quiz app with 3 quizzes called "Quizland". I wrote code like this to better learn class structure in Python.

What was done ?

- I did 3 exams.
- I have kept the user information.
- I calculated how long it takes the user to figure it out.
- By making the main menu, I acted according to the user's request.
- I presented the user's analysis visually.

My second project was a study where I analyzed earthquakes in Turkey and the Balkans in the last 40 years and focused on visualizations that answered various questions.

What was done ?

- Combining information from two different datasets
- Research questions were determined
- The hypotheses were tried to be explained with various graphics, statistical tests and maps.

# Thank You!
